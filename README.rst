Sawtooth Generic Discrete Message Transaction Processor
=======================================================

This is a Hyperledger Sawtooth transaction processor
that supports the "discrete generic message" protocol
for G2G messaging.

It is a prototype implementation
demonstrating key concepts from http://edi3.org.

See https://github.com/trustbridge/sawtooth-channel-example
for an example of how it can be run
(as part of a sawtooth network).
